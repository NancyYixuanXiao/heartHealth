## EC500 C1 Heart Health Project

This is a project for the course EC500 C1 in Bosotn University.
There are five us in total and we want to build a website for the kaggle project: Heart Diease Diagnosing.
In addition, in the website we build, we want the patients to upload their health data under their authorization and our website could give some feedback base on machine learning.
We would refer the database provided by Kaggle project sample data.
