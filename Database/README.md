###Dataset
 There are mainly two dataset applied to our project.
 First part is the excel file above is used for building the data model for prediagnose. 

 The second part is the the whole dataset consists of MRI images we download from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/data
 Because the database is huge, so we only put few data here for running. 
 You can download those data samples from : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzpV24TDyolPY3VzZlpQd3JDSXc/view?usp=sharing
 After unzip the file, each numbered folder stands for the data from one patient.
